# Multi-Armed Bandits for Anime Recommendation System

This repository contains the implementation of a reinforcement learning project using Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) for an Anime Recommendation System. The project leverages various MAB algorithms to provide personalized anime suggestions based on user preferences.

## Dataset
The Anime Recommendation Database 2020 from Kaggle is used in this project. You can find the dataset here: [Anime Recommendation Database 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020).

## Implemented Algorithms
The following Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms have been implemented to optimize the recommendation process:
* Epsilon-Greedy
* Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
* Thompson Sampling

Each algorithm explores and exploits the anime database to provide recommendations based on user interactions.
